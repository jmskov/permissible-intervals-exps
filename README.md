These tools require the following unregistered Julia packages (TODO: script to install these):

- DataSandbox - https://github.com/jmskov/DataSandbox
- PosteriorBounds - https://github.com/aria-systems-group/PosteriorBounds.jl
- TransitionIntervals - https://github.com/jmskov/TransitionIntervals.jl

For each of these, you can install them by running `]add <package-name>` in the Julia REPL. 
Use `]dev <package-name>` to install the development version.
